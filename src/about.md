Hi, I'm Ross, a software engineer based in the beautiful city of Bath, England.

I have worked in the world of software for many years, and have been fortunate to work in a variety of different industries and locations. My passion is using software to solve challenging problems.

From building high-performance ticketing systems to scalable data infrastructure, I've worked on a wide range of projects that have allowed me to develop my skills in software development. I am curious about many different aspects of technology and am always eager to learn new things.

I am currently working for [Mystic AI](https://www.mystic.ai/) as a Senior Software Engineer, where I am helping to make machine learning more accessible by building easy-to-use tools and infrastructure.

Thank you for taking the time to visit my website. If you have any questions or would like to learn more about my work, please don't hesitate to [get in touch](mailto:{{site.email}})!
